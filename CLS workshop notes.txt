CLS workshop notes

interdependence seems the way to go

i think we should go self sufficiency


what are the consequences of choosing different goals?
  let's pursue the smiley face was an arbitrary goal

pre defined roles
  



----
if students were grouped and had different scenarios with specific needs of a population/community - then directed strategies could be created


goal could vary by different content areas – 
  in science, it could be about water
  in some other subject - 


leaving goals undirected – 
  people wanted a spreadsheet to understand the entire system and figure out an optimal method
  spreadsheet - to figure out underlying dynamics of gold to happiness, or else.

!! having kids design the underlying model and play with that !!

having moderated conversations about how to make the cities work
  how can teachers be facilitated in moderation?

like later stages of spore:
  like terraforming and workin with a complex world

much longer turns, like over days, might involve a completely different play
  how would that look?

longer time might also make space for more equitable discussions - establish democratic processes

DESIGN:
- timer for rounds

- losing resources on failed bids would force negotiating on bids


- hex system for space and visual interface
