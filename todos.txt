TODOS

BUGS:
- the fixed navbar breaks things?
// - the confirm placement popup is wrong currently
// - update year for all accounts
// - change river's diagonal contact with red city

Tutorial:
  give everyone buildings in the first round
  add tooltip for resource icons

Base view tells what phase the game is in - bidding or buildings

all online features
  way to tell team composition
  city view button of committing bids (and building statuses)
  combine base view with user view **tricky

confusions:
- tried to play copper mine on copper ore; how to make clearer that you can only place on your city tiles
- running/stopped switch

- notify when you receive a trade
- make trades promise based?

more feedback:
  - tell building ownership; bid feedback is important

nicer future ui things:
  lumber amount should change woods icon
  do more graphical output of pollution from cities

next features:
  add population, happiness changes
  add renewability
  make bidding row look better - actually have images
    give bidding feedback - either reset bids, and/or give an update
  hitsory of things


futures:
- owned copper/clay/other resources throughout the universe
- 

------


tutorialize
  the second row of numbers is upcoming info (Expected usage)
    value of making it accurate, or mark it as expected run
  disappear production info in bidding phase

// Update if bidding is over stock

// Update information panel and building placing panel with information

//make remove and place building – confirmation based

//highlight selected cell
  //add a table border, and then show selected

***Future:
- possibly add cty details from center view


UI:
- history of trades
- mapTiles are loaded from database

// **- highlight selected cell
// - parse placable buildings' info onto the thing
// - add more useful information panel

// - toggle images works on city view as well
// - reintegrate employment check in running buildings

Info

- detailed view of buildings/map cells
  - aggregate information of round production
  - 
- feedback on marketplace bids –> failed bids, succeeded bids
- block placing of buildings on disfunctional cells
- add the metrics text back in

game design:
- imbalance of resources we could roll with
- 

- make changes in population/pollution/happiness more salient



Future UI:
- neighbor calculation is pretty bad and slowing down client a lot

// - DEBUG: city views for other cities


// add a building to unspecified location but ownership

// pending methods:
  // buy building (from auction to ownershio)
  // place building on map (from ownership to map)

----------------------------------

task: 
  make a meteor project, make a phaser map that changes 


--- send out a city settlers meeting


--- separate bidding + production rounds? production before bidding if doing this simultaneously

- CLS workshop
  neighbors ui

  in between round reflection
  make register link bigger if possible

  change play games to live games 
  change groups to cities


what do people like or not like about the game?
how they see it fitting into curricular designs?

possible questions for different audiences
one about learning, and integrating into history class, science class, etc
  fliexibility for different contexts

hci - designing information on different screens – engage in different ways in more manageable ways – individual screens are supposed to be manageable
  * What would you change? What do you like and what do you dislike? Have layout conversation

ask people about the different data streams, and how they would use it
  
let's come up with questions
